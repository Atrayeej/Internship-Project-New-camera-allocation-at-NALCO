# Internship Project Report: New Camera Allocation to existing CCTV network at NALCO Smelter Plant

During my internship at the NALCO smelter plant, I was assigned a project by my guide, Deputy Manager of Electronics and Instrumentation, to enhance the plant’s security by allocating 50 new PTZ and bullet cameras. 



## Project Steps

1. **Inspection of Existing Cameras**: 
   - Inspected the locations of existing cameras and understood their coverage areas.
   - Visited the control room, where all camera feeds are monitored by CISF officials.
   - Analyzed the control room setup, including PoE switches and NVRs connected to the IP CCTV cameras.

2. **Identifying Key Areas for New Cameras**: 
   - Identified entry and exit points for vehicles, vulnerable spots prone to theft, and other critical zones within the plant premises.
   - Discovered several black spots that were previously left uncovered by the existing camera network, posing significant security risks.

3. **Calculating Requirements**: 
   - Calculated the required network speed.
   - Determined the number of switches and NVRs needed.
   - Pinpointed the specifications and requirements for each camera, which will be communicated to the proposed CCTV production company.

## Recommendations

- **Strategic Placement**: 
  - Enhance monitoring capabilities.
  - Cover previously neglected black spots.
  - Improve response times to security incidents.
  - Reduce theft of precious goods, thereby minimizing government losses.

- **Firewall Configurations**: 
  - Recommended proper firewall configurations to protect against potential cyber threats.
  - Secure the network and maintain the integrity of the surveillance system.

## Conclusion

The addition of new cameras will significantly bolster the plant’s security and operational efficiency. By strategically placing the new cameras and ensuring proper network security, we can achieve enhanced safety and reduced losses for the government.
